# Arduino LED On/Off TCP

This example shows how to communicate with an Arduino board
using either a WiFi-shield or an Ethernet shield.

To use a WiFi shield, run arduinowifi.ino on the Arduino.
Before running arduinowifi.ino, edit the file to add your WiFi SSID and password,
and remove the associated #error directive.

To use an Ethernet shield, run arduinoethernet.ino on the Arduino.
