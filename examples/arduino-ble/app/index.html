		<p>This app shows how to connect to an Arduino BLE shield. Note that you must run this app in the EvoThings client app, or build a Cordova app with the plugin com.evothings.ble. Device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3 or higher required.</p>
		<p><b>Example circuit:</b><br /><img src="arduino-ble-board-sketch.png" style="max-height:30%;" /></p>
		<p><b>How it works:</b> The ON &amp; OFF buttons controls digital pin 2 on the Arduino which is here connected to an LED. The plot shows the input from analog pin A0 which is here connected to a variable resistor (potentiometer). Please experiment with your own circuits and let us know how cool they are!</p>
		<p><b>Troubleshooting:</b> There are known problems with that BLE stops working on multiple reloads. In this case, <b>1)</b> stop the EvoThings client app, <b>2)</b> turn off and on your Bluetooth, and <b>3)</b> start the EvoThings client app again. Additionally, you can use the EvoThings Workbench Tools to see any error messages that may help in your investigation.</p>
